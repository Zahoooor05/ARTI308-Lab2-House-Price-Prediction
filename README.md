# ARTI308-Lab2-House-Price-Prediction
### Project Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes real estate information such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of nearby convenience stores, and geographic location. The task is a regression problem because the target variable is a numerical value representing house price.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains real estate transaction data from an urban area. Each row represents one property transaction. The dataset includes the following features:
- Transaction date  
- House age  
- Distance to the nearest MRT station  
- Number of convenience stores  
- Latitude  
- Longitude  

This dataset is suitable for regression analysis and understanding factors that influence house prices.
